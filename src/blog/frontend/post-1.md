Hello everyone! Welcome to my new blog, my name is Yoon Foo! Here, I will share my learning journey about every aspect of technology.

### What I will share:

1. **Frontend**: First, every framework I learned about frontend development will be shared here.
2. **Backend**: Everything about backend will go here.
3. **Web Scraping**: I love data, bunch of data, so I will also share my knowledge about web scraping.
4. **Database**:  Recently I'm lack of knowledge about database, so I will learn database too.

I like to learn many many thing.
